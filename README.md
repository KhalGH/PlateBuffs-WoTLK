# PlateBuffs

**PlateBuffs** is a legacy addon originally created by Cyprias, with its final version released for WoW 6.0.2. It was later backported by Kader for WoW 3.3.5a.  
This repository contains a modified version of Kader's backport, featuring enhancements and additions.

## Additional Features
- Added some extra textures for the icon border.
- Added an option to change the anchor point of the duration text.
- Added new categories for Default Spells, plus a control list to filter specific spells by spellID (to handle spells that share name). Also included class-based logic to dynamically add more Default Spells depending on the player's class.
- Improved the blink animation and added a complementary fade-out animation, both designed as timing cues to help the user better perceive when a buff or debuff is about to expire.
- Reorganized the user interface, arranging features in a more appropriate order.
